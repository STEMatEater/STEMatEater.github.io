<p class="para1">Learn On: Build Forward: STEM is Science, Technonlogy, Engineering and Mathematics.  Every day in class students
want to learn on through building forward.  Below you can click on a particular grade and see projects that
that students have built and how they have learned from it or learned by building it.  Eather way, learning is the goal Building is the vehicle</p>

<img class="imagec" src="Newtons_Cradle_images/step8.jpg">ABSTRACT: Newton’s Cradles are cool desktop toys that might amuse someone for a minute.  
They actually demonstrate the law of Conservation.  This is the first of the three laws of Thermodynamics and states that ...energy cannot be created or destroyed
The second law of thermodynamics can also be seen after this build.  Follow the communicated results and build Newton’s Cradle.  
After you build it try it out and see if you can figure out how the second law of thermodynamics can be seen in this build.

<!-- not using this div tag because I cannot understand the spacing surrounding it. see css div tag for more of the same complaint. after 11 hours, and much research, I feel it best
to have projects and learning input using class identifiers because div tags are better used to divide the site into sections and I see my pages being divided into three main sections,
1. intro (plus menu bar) 2. projects (for student pages, student projects, for my pages, school projects by grade level.) 3. on the left, a search function so all student projects can be searched through by tags or titles of some kind.
