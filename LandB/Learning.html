<p class="paragraphb"><b>6th Grade Unit 1</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Research/Computer Literacy</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Re-Build: <a href="">Slideshow</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="flashlight.jpg">ABSTRACT:  In the ever changing world of the internet, how do we know what is credible?  to answer this question join us as we learn the six things that makes
an online source credible and place this information in a short slideshow.  This unit also teaches basic computer literacy including typing.</p>

<p class="paragraphb"><b>6th Grade Unit 2</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Electrical Circuitry</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Re-Build: <a href="">Flashlights</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="flashlight.jpg">ABSTRACT:  What makes up an electrical Circuit?  In this unit we learn that there are four essential parts to an electrical Circuit, What each part demonstrates
and how they go together.  We get to apply this knowledge of simple electrical circuits by fixing flashlights and recording how in our science journals.</p>

<p class="paragraphb"><b>6th Grade Unit 3</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Programming</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Build: <a href="">Scratch</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="flashlight.jpg">ABSTRACT:  How do computers do so many complex things?  The answer may be simple, once you understand.  To learn writing you trace, read and answer simple questions.
To learn code you build some basic programs on scratch and build your programming literacy!</p>

<p class="paragraphb"><b>6th Grade Unit 4</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Engineering and Blueprints</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Re-Build: <a href="">Toothpick Bridges</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="flashlight.jpg">ABSTRACT:  What forces act on a bridge?  How do you combat these forces with geometric structres and maaterials?  These questions and more are 
answered by this unit where you get to draw a blueprint, build your bridge and test it to see if yours is the strongest.</p>

<!-- not using this div tag because I cannot understand the spacing surrounding it. see css div tag for more of the same complaint. after 11 hours, and much research, I feel it best
to have projects and learning input using class identifiers because div tags are better used to divide the site into sections and I see my pages being divided into three main sections,
1. intro (plus menu bar) 2. projects (for student pages, student projects, for my pages, school projects by grade level.) 3. on the left, a search function so all student projects can be searched through by tags or titles of some kind.
