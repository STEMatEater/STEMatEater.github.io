<img class="imagec" src="flashlight.jpg">ABSTRACT:  In the ever changing world of the internet, how do we know what is credible?  to answer this question join us as we learn the six things that makes
an online source credible and place this information in a short slideshow.  This unit also teaches basic computer literacy including typing.</p>

<p class="paragraphb"><b>6th Grade Unit 2</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Electrical Circuitry</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Re-Build: <a href="">Flashlights</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="flashlight.jpg">ABSTRACT:  What makes up an electrical Circuit?  In this unit we learn that there are four essential parts to an electrical Circuit, What each part demonstrates
and how they go together.  We get to apply this knowledge of simple electrical circuits by fixing flashlights and recording how in our science journals.</p>

<p class="paragraphb"><b>6th Grade Unit 3</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Programming</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Build: <a href="">Scratch</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="flashlight.jpg">ABSTRACT:  How do computers do so many complex things?  The answer may be simple, once you understand.  To learn writing you trace, read and answer simple questions.
To learn code you build some basic programs on scratch and build your programming literacy!</p>

<p class="paragraphb"><b>6th Grade Unit 4</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Engineering and Blueprints</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Re-Build: <a href="">Toothpick Bridges</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="flashlight.jpg">ABSTRACT:  What forces act on a bridge?  How do you combat these forces with geometric structres and maaterials?  These questions and more are 
answered by this unit where you get to draw a blueprint, build your bridge and test it to see if yours is the strongest.</p>


<p class="paragraphr"><b>7th Grade Unit 1</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Planets Light and Color</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Build: <a href="">Foam Magnet</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png">ABSTRACT:  Why do we see things?  This question seems obvious from a anatomical point of veiw.  But is it?  
In this unit we will get a view of light as it starts in the stars and lights eventually travelling
through are windows reflecting, refraccting, and scattering through everything in its path.</p>

<p class="paragraphr"><b>7th Grade Unit 2</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Engineering Method</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Build: <a href="">Electrical Houses</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png">ABSTRACT:  What do you do with problems?  For an engineer, a problem is just the starting point of their work.  In fact some of the first steps they take is just
focused on identifying, and defining the problem to ensure they give it their best.  The problem could be anything from the many the holes in socks to global warming.  
First though, we must learn and practice using the Engineering Method</p>

<p class="paragraphr"><b>7th Grade Unit 3</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">I Survived (Engineering)</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Build: <a href="">Your own Prototype</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png">ABSTRACT:  If you could invent one thing, what would it be??  In this life saving look at problems in "I survived" books, we want to do just that.  Identify problems 
natural disasters cause for each protagonist in the books.  Write an Engineering Method to solve that problem. Build your prototype.  Then mock sell your idea to a panel like a real Engineer team.</p>
	
<p class="paragraphr"><b>7th Grade Unit 4</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">About Electricity</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Build: <a href="">Basic Circuit Boards</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png">ABSTRACT:  What is electricty?  this needs to be thought out more if its going to be used...</p>

<p class="paragraphr"><b>7th Grade Unit 5</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Coding for Robots</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Design: <a href="">Sphero Programs</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png">ABSTRACT:  How do robots know what to do?  In eighth grade you will get a taste of computer code and how it is that this site was built.  But here we will look at robots and how they 
take in code and use it to move and even solve mazes.</p>
	
<p class="paragraphr"><b>7th Grade Unit 6</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Computer Programming</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Build: <a href="">Scratch Game</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png">ABSTRACT:  Can machines understand us?  The low level and high level answer might be no, and that is why their are "translator" languages.  this
unit supposes you took Programming in 6th grade but is still doable if you didn't.  Prepare to learn mare from solving Programming puzzles and working towards building your own unique Scratch Game.
</p>
	
<p class="paragraphr"><b>7th Grade Unit 7</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Engineering Method</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Re-Build: <a href="">Hand or Marble Labyrinth</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png">ABSTRACT:  How do  you pick things up?  We all know the simple answer, but can you design a machine that will pick things up as you would?  Differentiate and use 
blueprint to build one or both of these fun machines.  You will be presented with the opportunity to solve problems as an engineer would today.</p>
		
<p class="paragraphr"><b>7th Grade Unit 1</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Movement, Inertia, Potential, Kinetic</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Re-Build: <a href="">Ping-Pong Roller Coaster</a></br>
<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png">ABSTRACT:  Why are roller coasters so fast?  We know the simple answer but can we illustrate it and build are own unique designs?  In this unit
you will get to build your own roller coaster and analyze what makes it fast.</p>
	




<p class="paragraphg"><b>8th Grade Unit 1</b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Learn: <a href="">Planets Light and Color</a>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Re-Build: <a href="">Foam Magnet</a></br>
	<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png">ABSTRACT:  Why do we see things.  This is partly a review from 7th Grade but is mainly a chance to start making things quickly and discuss Why
we remember certain things.  How do we learn? How does are learning influence what we are able to make and eventually do later in life.</p>

<!-- not using this div tag because I cannot understand the spacing surrounding it. see css div tag for more of the same complaint. after 11 hours, and much research, I feel it best
to have projects and learning input using class identifiers because div tags are better used to divide the site into sections and I see my pages being divided into three main sections,
1. intro (plus menu bar) 2. projects (for student pages, student projects, for my pages, school projects by grade level.) 3. on the left, a search function so all student projects can be searched through by tags or titles of some kind.
