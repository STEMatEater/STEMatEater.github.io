<img class="imagea" src="Tener.png">That's me! Mr. Tener. I am excited about teaching and specifically about teaching this year for a number of reasons.  First, 
new students come in with a passion to learn in an interactive environment.  It is great to see the interest with which students latch onto a piece of information 
and design something around it.  This gives me a new perspective on solving problems.  I also canâ€™t wait for returning students who want to further their knowledge or 
learn about and engineer a new solution in STEM.  In short, I am excited about the students, and what they will learn!</p>

<img class="imagec" src="imagehere.png"><b>Quick Synopsis of 6th Grade STEM:</b>
We will complete four main projects including Researched Slideshows, Flashlight Construction, Block Coding, and Bridge Engineering
<br>
We (the students of this class) want to see and use connections between Science, Technology,
 Engineering and Mathematics</p>

<!-- not using this div tag because I cannot understand the spacing surrounding it. see css div tag for more of the same complaint. after 11 hours, and much research, I feel it best
to have projects and learning input using class identifiers because div tags are better used to divide the site into sections and I see my pages being divided into three main sections,
1. intro (plus menu bar) 2. projects (for student pages, student projects, for my pages, school projects by grade level.) 3. on the left, a search function so all student projects can be searched through by tags or titles of some kind.
