<!-- not using this div tag because I cannot understand the spacing surrounding it. see css div tag for more of the same complaint. after 11 hours, and much research, I feel it best
to have projects and learning input using class identifiers because div tags are better used to divide the site into sections and I see my pages being divided into three main sections,
1. intro (plus menu bar) 2. projects (for student pages, student projects, for my pages, school projects by grade level.) 3. on the left, a search function so all student projects can be searched through by tags or titles of some kind.
